## About The Project

A traffic system that could handle multipe autonomous cars in a street junction. 
This project is realised using arduino IDE and freeRTOS. 
The state chart for this project is simulated using UPPAAL.


## Guide

Inside the "RTOS Autonomous Traffic System" folder, you will find the main code of our autonomous traffic system which could be opened using arduino IDE.
Inside the "UPPAAL Model" folder, you will find images of our state charts involved in our system, and the project file that could be opened using UPPAAL.
Inside the "VHDL Model" folder, you will find a VHD file of one of our state charts, which is the request handler.
